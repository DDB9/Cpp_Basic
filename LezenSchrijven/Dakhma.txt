They knew he would come
As he always had
As he always will
To feast on the blood of the wicked

The Doom Slayer sought to end the dominion of the dark realm
Despair spread before him, like a plague
Striking fear into the shadow dwellers
Driving them to deeper and darker pits

His power grew
Swift and unrelenting
