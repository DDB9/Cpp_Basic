In the first age
In the first battle
When the shadows first lengthened
One stood

He chose the path of perpetual torment
In his ravenous hatred he found no peace
And with boiling blood he scoured the umbral plains
Seeking vengeance against the dark lords who had wronged him

And those that tasted the bite of his sword named him
The Doom Slayer
